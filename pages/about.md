# **About Me**

INSERT CENTERED PIC

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm a game designer by trade and a game designer by ...not ...trade. I just like making games and game-adjacent things!

At the moment I'm living in beautiful Oakland, California with my fiance Katie and our lil' dog Norah. We love to travel and hope to move to Europe in the next few years.
