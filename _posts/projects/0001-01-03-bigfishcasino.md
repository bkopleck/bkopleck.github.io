<!-- FACTSHEET END -->

Big Fish Casino is a social casino mobile game for which I designed eleven slot machines, including a Baywatch movie promotional slot machine and Aztec Gold: The Lost City, the #1 slot for 10 months after its launch. While many of my slots were mechanical reskins, I was given a few opportunities to try new mechanics. These slots are my most interesting attempts.
