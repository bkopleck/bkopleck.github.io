<!-- FACTSHEET END -->

_Skulldug!_ is a competitive pulp adventure board game. It began life as a promising game jam prototype in early 2013 and went through two years of iteration before being self-published on Kickstarter in 2015. The project was successfully funded at 220% of our goal, and months later, 2000 copies were printed and shipped to players around the world!

### Gameplay Overview

Players explore a cave together competing for the goal of returning to the cave entrance with three Treasures in hand. When a player moves into an undiscovered area, they’ll add a new passage tile to the map, revealing Hazards they must encounter _(Monsters and Traps)_ and/or Fortunes they may acquire _(Consumables, Equipment, and Treasure)_.

Each turn, a player may spend three Action Points to do things like move, pick up and drop items, shove or throw items at another player, destroy an existing tile, or improve their roll in an encounter. If a player loses all of their health, they drop their items into the passage they died in and respawn at the cave entrance on their next turn.

### Design Learnings

_Skulldug!_ came from an obsession with roguelikes and the emergent narratives of procedural generation. That procedural generation was the aspect we iterated on most; the first version had cave passages, items, and monsters all shuffled into the same deck, and exploring was simply drawing cards until you drew a passage and putting everything prior into it. The control we gained by having passages specify their contents was hugely important to the consistency of the experience. It was a great exploration of mixing top down themes for emergent narrative and bottom up mechanics for fluid gameplay.

Personally, my favorite design bit of _Skulldug!_ are the curses on Treasures. Having the items required for victory also hinder players adds a natural rubber banding to the game outcome, it feels thematic for pulp adventure, and makes for some great decision moments: if this is the first piece of Treasure I’ve discovered, do I endure its curse and swap a useful item for it, or leave it covered in traps and hope no one else tries to claim it?

Looking back on Skulldug, I can see some of the rough edges that come from it being a novice designer’s first real game, but I’m still incredibly thankful that the game was a success and I was able to learn so much from the process. All said, I’m still proud to have my name on it.
